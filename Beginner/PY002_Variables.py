##      Creating Variables
##
####
# Python has no command for declaring a variable like other programming languages have.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5
name = "John"

print(x) # prints 5 that is assigned to variable x.
print(name) # prints John that is assigned to variable name.

# variable type is decided by what value is assigned to its variable.
